  storyText: 'As you move towards the noise you see a flame flick into life. You are
    in an old boiler room. The boiler roars to life. As you watch the boiler walls
    begin to glow. You imagine they are begining to swell...

    In the gloom you can see a door. There is also a switch marked to set the boiler
    to Standby.


    1. Go through the door

    2. Flip the switch and back away from the boiler'
