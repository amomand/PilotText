It is dark, you cannot see clearly. There is a quite ticking noise nearby that you have been trying to locate for some time.

Move towards the noise (A2)
Move away from the noise (A3)


A2
As you move towards the noise you see a flame flick into into life. It's a pilot light. You are in a boiler room. The boiler roars to life. As you watch the boiler walls begin to be glowing. In the gloom you can see a door. There is also a switch marked to set the boiler to Standby.

Go through the door (A4)
Flip the switch and back away from the boiler (A3)


A3
Your back is against a wall. There does not appear to be anywhere else to go.

Wait here (A5)
Move back towards the noise (A2)

A4
Success! you made it out of the boiler room.

A5
A searing pain tears thgough your chest and you crumple to the gorund. The last thing you hear are footsteps walking away...
