A1
It is dark, you cannot see clearly. There is a quite ticking noise nearby that you have been trying to locate for some time.

Move towards the noise (A2)
Move away from the noise (A3)


A2
As you move towards the noise you see a flame flick into into life. It's a pilot light. You are in a boiler room. In the gloom you can see a door.

Go through the door (A4)
Move away from the noise of the boiler (A3)


A3
Your back is against a wall. There does not appear to be anyway to go.

Wait here.
Move towards the noise.

A4
Success! you made it out of the boiler room.
